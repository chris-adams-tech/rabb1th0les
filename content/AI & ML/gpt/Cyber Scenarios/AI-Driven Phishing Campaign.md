### **Scenario: AI-Driven Phishing Campaign and Social Engineering Attack**

#### **Background:**
It’s Friday morning, and employees in the finance department report receiving emails that appear to be from the Head of Finance (`FinanceHead@company.com`). The emails contain well-written, contextually relevant messages with instructions for wire transfers to new vendors, referencing ongoing projects and specific employee names in a convincing manner. The emails include links to a secure document that requests users to log in via a Microsoft 365 login page.

You quickly determine that these emails are generated by a large language model (LLM) like GPT, likely used by an attacker to craft convincing, context-aware messages. The attacker has likely scraped data from social media and other online sources to personalize the emails, increasing the likelihood that employees will trust and act on the requests.

#### **Alert Summary and Log Sources:**

1. **Multiple Phishing Emails with AI-Generated Content (Email Security Gateway)**  
   Type: Email Security Alert  
   Source: Impersonated Account `FinanceHead@company.com`  
   Description: Outbound emails appear to be from `FinanceHead@company.com` but contain subtle anomalies that suggest impersonation. The emails reference ongoing projects and contain detailed information about specific employees and finance processes.

2. **Unusual Login Patterns Detected (Azure AD)**  
   Type: Identity Protection Alert  
   Source: Multiple Finance and HR Accounts  
   Description: Several high-privilege accounts in finance and HR (`FinanceHead@company.com`, `HRDirector@company.com`, and `Accountant1@company.com`) show unusual login attempts from foreign IP addresses and unusual devices following the phishing campaign.

3. **Spike in Wire Transfer Requests (Finance System Logs)**  
   Type: Financial Transaction Alert  
   Source: Finance Department  
   Description: Anomalous wire transfer requests were initiated through the finance system by accounts that recently received the phishing email. These transfers were flagged for large amounts and include new bank account information that has not been verified before.

4. **Suspicious Document Sharing on Internal Collaboration Tool (Microsoft Teams)**  
   Type: Collaboration Security Alert  
   Source: `FinanceHead@company.com`  
   Description: A document labeled “Secure Vendor Details” was shared with the finance team via Microsoft Teams from `FinanceHead@company.com`. The document contains a link to an external document-sharing platform that prompts users for Microsoft 365 login credentials.

  - **9:00 AM** - Phishing emails sent to 20 employees in finance and HR.
  - **9:05 AM** - 12 employees clicked on the email link, and 6 attempted to log in to the fake login page.

**Analysis:**  
The use of an AI-driven phishing campaign is apparent from the sophistication and personalization of the emails. The attacker’s LLM-generated content includes details scraped from LinkedIn profiles and project updates, making it difficult for employees to recognize it as phishing.

<div class="neon-line"></div>

#### **Alert 2: Unusual Login Patterns Detected (Azure AD)**

**Telemetry Data (Azure AD Identity Protection Logs):**
- **Affected Accounts**: `FinanceHead@company.com`, `HRDirector@company.com`, `Accountant1@company.com`
- **Unfamiliar Login Locations**:  
  - **Source IPs**: 203.0.113.45, 198.51.100.60 (both foreign IPs associated with previous phishing attacks).
  - **Unusual Devices**: Access attempts from unrecognized devices on several accounts.
- **Event Timeline**:
  - **9:15 AM** - Login attempt on `FinanceHead@company.com` from 203.0.113.45.
  - **9:30 AM** - Login attempt on `HRDirector@company.com` from 198.51.100.60.

**Analysis:**  
These login attempts follow shortly after users entered credentials on the phishing page, indicating that the attacker is using the stolen credentials to attempt immediate access to high-value accounts.

<div class="neon-line"></div>

#### **Alert 3: Spike in Wire Transfer Requests (Finance System Logs)**

**Telemetry Data (Finance System Logs):**
- **Source Accounts**: `FinanceHead@company.com`, `Accountant1@company.com`
- **Wire Transfer Details**:
  - Large transfer requests to new vendor accounts flagged as suspicious.
  - Transfer destinations: offshore accounts with limited previous interaction with the company.
- **Event Timeline**:
  - **9:45 AM** - Transfer request of $150,000 from `FinanceHead@company.com`.
  - **9:50 AM** - Transfer request of $75,000 from `Accountant1@company.com`.

**Analysis:**  
These wire transfer requests align with the timeline of the phishing emails and compromised logins, indicating that the attacker is attempting to use compromised accounts for financial gain.

<div class="neon-line"></div>

#### **Alert 4: Suspicious Document Sharing on Internal Collaboration Tool (Microsoft Teams)**

**Telemetry Data (Microsoft Teams Logs):**
- **Source Account**: `FinanceHead@company.com`
- **Shared Document**: “Secure Vendor Details”
- **Event Timeline**:
  - **9:30 AM** - Document shared on Teams with finance staff.
- **Document Link**:
  - Leads to an external site mimicking a Microsoft 365 login page, requesting user credentials.

**Analysis:**  
The attacker is using the internal collaboration tool to distribute phishing links and target additional employees, expanding the attack beyond email to leverage trusted internal channels.

<div class="neon-line"></div>

### **Investigation Steps**

Here’s a step-by-step approach to analyze the AI-driven phishing campaign and understand the attacker’s strategy.

#### **Step 1: Analyze Phishing Emails for AI-Generated Content Patterns**

- **Review Email Headers and Content**:
  - Examine email headers to identify anomalies indicating spoofed addresses or impersonation.
  - Analyze the email content for signs of AI generation, such as unusually contextually relevant language, personalized information, and references to recent project updates.

- **Identify Information Sources**:
  - Determine how the attacker obtained project names and employee details. Check public profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) for any exposed information the attacker might have used to train or prompt an LLM.

#### **Step 2: Investigate Login Attempts with Compromised Credentials**

- **Cross-Reference Login Attempts (Azure AD)**:
  - Review the timeline of login attempts across the organization following the phishing email.
  - Flag unfamiliar IP addresses and devices and monitor for successful logins from these sources to prevent lateral movement.

- **Correlate with Click and Login Patterns**:
  - Match phishing email recipients to Azure AD logs to identify which employees clicked the link and entered credentials on the fake page.

#### **Step 3: Monitor Wire Transfer Requests for Compromised Accounts**

- **Examine Financial System Logs**:
  - Review all recent wire transfer requests for irregularities, such as requests to new accounts or foreign banks.
  - Identify which accounts made unusual transfer requests and confirm if they had received the phishing email.

- **Initiate Holds on Suspicious Transactions**:
  - Put any flagged transactions on hold until they can be verified as legitimate.

#### **Step 4: Investigate Document Sharing in Microsoft Teams**

- **Review Internal Collaboration Logs**:
  - Check Microsoft Teams activity to identify all users who accessed the document labeled “Secure Vendor Details.”
  - Identify additional users who may have clicked on the phishing link within the document.

- **Monitor Internal Channels for Further Phishing Attempts**:
  - Use DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies to block any further attempts to share documents containing phishing links across internal communication tools.

### **Containment and Remediation Actions**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Disable Compromised Accounts**: Lock accounts of users who entered their credentials on the phishing page, including `FinanceHead@company.com` and `Accountant1@company.com`.
   - **Reset Passwords Organization-Wide**: Require password resets for all employees in finance and HR, especially those who received the phishing email or accessed the Teams document.
   - **Cancel or Verify Wire Transfers**: Work with the finance department to verify and hold any pending wire transfers requested by compromised accounts.

2. **Remediation:**
   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA on all accounts, especially those in high-value departments such as finance and HR.
   - **Block Malicious Domains and IPs**: Block access to phishing URLs like `securelogin-document.com` and suspicious IPs (e.g., 203.0.113.45, 198.51.100.60) at the network level to prevent further access.
   - **Implement Advanced Phishing Detection**: Use AI-based email security tools

 that can detect AI-generated phishing content, including personalized, context-aware language.

3. **Long-Term Security Improvements:**
   - **Enhance User Awareness Training**: Educate employees about the increased use of AI in phishing campaigns, including tips on recognizing sophisticated, contextually relevant phishing emails.
   - **Monitor External Data Exposure**: Review publicly accessible employee data and project information on social media and professional networks. Implement guidelines to limit exposure of sensitive details that could aid in social engineering.
   - **Implement Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Use behavioral monitoring tools to identify unusual transaction requests and abnormal communication patterns within collaboration tools, allowing faster detection of future attacks.
