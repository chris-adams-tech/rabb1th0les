## Overview
Heartbleed is one of the most significant vulnerabilities ever discovered in the OpenSSL cryptographic library. The bug allows attackers to read sensitive memory contents from affected systems, potentially exposing private keys, passwords, and other sensitive data.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Definition | A serious vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library that allows stealing information protected under normal conditions by SSL/TLS encryption |
| CVE ID | CVE-2014-0160 |
| Affected Systems | OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f |
| Severity | Critical (CVSS 3.0 Base Score: 7.5) |
| Discovery Date | April 2014 |
| Discovered By | Neel Mehta (Google Security) |

## Technical Details
The vulnerability exists in OpenSSL's implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat extension (RFC 6520). 

### How it Works
1. The TLS heartbeat extension works by allowing a computer at one end of a TLS connection to verify that its peer at the other end is still present by sending a `HeartbeatRequest` message:
```c
struct {
  uint8 type;
  uint16 payload_length;
  opaque payload[payload_length];
  opaque padding[padding_length];
} HeartbeatMessage;
```

2. The vulnerability occurs because the code fails to validate the length of the heartbeat message properly:
   - Attacker sends a malformed heartbeat request with a small payload but claims a larger size
   - Server allocates memory based on the claimed size
   - Server copies actual (smaller) payload plus adjacent memory contents
   - Server returns this memory to the attacker

## Notable Incidents
- Affected approximately 17% of SSL-enabled web servers at time of discovery
- Major services impacted included:
  - Yahoo
  - Imgur
  - Reddit
  - GitHub
  - Many government websites

## Impact
### Security Implications
- Exposure of private keys
- Compromise of SSL/TLS certificates
- Disclosure of user credentials
- Exposure of sensitive memory contents
- Potential for complete compromise of affected systems

## Mitigation and Detection

### Prevention
1. Update OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g or later
2. Reissue all SSL certificates used on affected systems
3. Force password changes for all users

### Detection Methods
- Network monitoring for excessive heartbeat requests
- IDS/IPS signatures looking for heartbeat patterns
- Vulnerability scanners specifically checking for Heartbleed
```bash
# Example Nmap detection
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed <target>
```

### Incident Response
1. Immediate patching of affected systems
2. Revocation of compromised SSL certificates
3. Implementation of new SSL certificates
4. Force reset of all user credentials
5. Review of logs for potential exploitation
