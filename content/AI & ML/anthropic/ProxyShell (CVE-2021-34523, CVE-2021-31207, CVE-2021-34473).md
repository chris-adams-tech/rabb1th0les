```powershell
# Example Exchange IIS Log patterns to monitor
GET /autodiscover/autodiscover.json
POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.json
```

### Network Indicators
- Suspicious PowerShell requests to `/autodiscover/autodiscover.json`
- Anomalous POST requests to Exchange endpoints
- Unexpected outbound connections from Exchange servers

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions
1. Apply Microsoft Security Updates:
   - KB5003435 (Exchange 2019)
   - KB5003435 (Exchange 2016)
   - KB5003435 (Exchange 2013)

### Preventive Measures
- Implement Network Segmentation
- Regular Security Updates
- Enhanced Monitoring
- Zero Trust Architecture Implementation

### Response Procedures
