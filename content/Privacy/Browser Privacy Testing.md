Internet communications continue to grow at a rapid pace with the introduction of cloud technologies and now AI tools. It is often easy to forget about the traffic that is happening on the backend and often times, we are so focused on the identifiers being the IP address. And they are very important to keep private, however, there are new ways to be tracked these days and a lot of that can stem from the browser. This includes the cookies, cached content, and other metadata that's not often easily seen.

There is an extension that I have been using called *Canvas Blocker*. Essentially, it blocks Canvas fingerprinting. The site links a website that is extremely helpful in testing what your system is exposing publicly.

Here is a link to the site: https://browserleaks.com/
# Capabilities for Privacy checking:

### IP address
* IP address
* reverse IP lookup
* HTTP request headers
* country, state, city, ISP/ASN, local time
### JavaScript
* User-Agent
* screen resolution
* system language
* local time
* CPU architecture
* number of logical cores
* battery status
* network information
* installed plugins
* more
### WebRTC Leak Test
* Critical for anyone using a VPN
	* leverages WebRTC API to communicate with a STUN server
		* can potentially reveal user's local and public IP addresses, even when using a VPN or proxy server
* WebGL Report
	* analyze browser's WebGL support
	* exposes information about graphics card and other WebGL and GPU capabilities 
	* can be used to differentiate your browser from others
* Canvas Fingerprinting
	* uses HTML5 Canvas code to generate a unique identifier for each individual user
* Geolocation API
	* allows websites to retrieve geographical location of a user
* SSL/TLS Client Test
	* checks browser's supported TLS protocols
* Content Filters
	* detectors to identify usage of content filters
