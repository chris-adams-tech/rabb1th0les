# What is agile?
Agile is a software development methodology emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and the iterative process of development.

### What is Iterative development?
   - Projects are broken down into small, more manageable phases
        - called _iterations_ or _sprints_
        - typically lasts 1-4 weeks
- Why the continuous customer collaboration?
    - By having frequent interaction with the customers or end-users, feedback gives crucial insight to developers to ensure the product meets their needs.
- Pros of adaptability
    - agile teams are able to respond quickly to changes in requirements or market conditions
