Workstations can have the security updates automatically patches and benchmarked via the CIS Benchmark standard for Workstations Level 1 & 2. All you need is an Ubuntu Pro account and this is free for up to 5 machines. 

I have been using it for a bit now and works like a charm. When booting a new Ubuntu machine, after the install, you are offered the option to attach your Ubuntu installation to Ubuntu Pro. If you choose this option, you just need to log in to the website, which will provide you with the access token to authenticate. 

Alternatively, you may also use the OTC generated on the Ubuntu machine.

*Screenshots coming soon*
