# Checking SHA256 signature on a file

Tags: Configuration, Linux, Self-Created

### Simple steps to check a file hash

### In this example, weâ€™ll download Parrot Security ISO file.

### Download the file

### Move into the folder where the file was downloaded

```bash
$ /home/<*username>/*Downloads/
```

### Download or go to the page with ownerâ€™s file hash values, in this case

![[quartz/content/img/sha.png]]
![[quartz/content/img/sha2.png]]

Enter the command below to check the respective hash
```
sha256sum <name-of-file>
```

<aside>
âœ… Ensure your pwd (present working directory) is where you downloaded your file to

List of hashes for Parrot Sec ISO files

The below file, `Parrot-security-6.0_amd64.iso` can be substituted for any file downloaded that you would like to check the checksum value for.

<aside>
âœ… You will notice if you start at `md5sum` , it will gradually take more time. This is because of the more complex crypotographic operations occurring in the background to calculate these hashes, takes more time.

</aside>

Now, we can see that these hashes match up with what is listed in the web page for Parrot Sec.

Thatâ€™s it!
