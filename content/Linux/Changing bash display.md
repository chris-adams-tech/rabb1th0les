At times, you may want to hide your username and host name. There are some commands we can put into the `~/ .bashrc` file that will hide this information

### To display only the username and the current working directory

```bash
PS1='\u@\w \$ '
```

If you would just like the Current Working directory, just remove the `\u` and all done!

To ensure this persists after reboots, this line needs to be added to the `~/ .bashrc` file.

Open the file with vim or nano. I'm a lame nano user ðŸ˜œ

```bash
nano ~/ .bashrc
```

Add the line on a new line in the file and save. Reopen the terminal prompt and good to go!
