**Data Stream for Input**
        STDIN ‚Äì 0
**Data Stream for Output**
        STDOUT ‚Äì 1
**Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.**
        STDERR ‚Äì 2

Now, what does this mean? And how do we use it?
## Redirecting data

Let's take an example looking for the string `shadow` in the `/etc/` directory. 

![[_attachments/lin-bash.png]]
* `find /etc/ -name shadow` - STDIN - 0
* `/etc/shadow` - STDOUT - 1
* `Permission denied` - STDERR -2

Let's say for the output, we don't want to see any of the errors (`STDERR - 2`).

The following code can be run to output and errors to `/dev/null`, essentially just getting rid out the output and not saving it anywhere.

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
```

![[_attachments/lin-bash1.png]]

This will only output the `STDOUT -1` or the `/etc/shadow` file, removing any extra noise from the errors that are produced.

The output can also be redirected to files, as seen below:

```bash
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt
```

Using a `>` to redirect `STDOUT` will create a new file automatically, if it does not exist. If it does exist, it will be overwritten without asking for confirmation.

If the goal is to *append* `STDOUT` to the existing file, use the `>>` sign.

```bash
find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
```

### Redirecting `STDIN` Stream to a file

```bash
cat << EOF > stream.txt
```

![[_attachments/lin-bash2.png]]
Notice from the screenshot below that the script will continue to go, until the command `EOF` is entered. Additionally, if the command is run multiple times, as we've discussed previously, the data will be overwritten.

### Using Pipes in Bash

Piping commands is extremely helpful for chaining tasks together, or in other words, when we want the `STDOUT` from one program to be processed by another. 

Let's say that you are using the `ls` command to list files in a directory. If there are tons of files, it can be hard to sort through. This is where the `|` (**Pipe**) comes in handy.

#### Another example piping commands together:

```bash
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```
