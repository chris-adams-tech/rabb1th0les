# Detection Opportunities

Golden ticket attacks can be tough to detect. This is because an actor can craft the ticket offline, thus not leaving a trace of the tool used to craft the ticket. 

Instead, we can focus on the extraction methods of the `krbtgt` hash. These can stem from the below attacks:

* **DCSync attack**
* **NTDS.dit file access**
* **LSASS memory read on domain controller** (Sysmon Event ID 10)

*Event ID 4720* can be used to detect newly created users. If a user was created in the process of either a Golden ticket or Silver ticket, that event ID will be generated. 

With these created users there is no validation of user permissions, and thus can be granted with admin privileges. 

*Event ID 4672* can be monitored to detect anomalous assigned privileges.
