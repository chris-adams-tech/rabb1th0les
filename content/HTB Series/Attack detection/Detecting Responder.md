For detecting events related to LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS Poisoning

> LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) poisoning

These are network level attacks that exploit inefficiencies in name resolution protocols.

LLMNR and NBT-NS are used to resolve local hostnames to IP addresses and can be exploited by attackers to resolve an unknown hostname to the attacker's IP address.

### Detection

This can be detected with Sysmon Event ID 22 by tracking the DNS queries associated with non-existent/mistyped files shares.
