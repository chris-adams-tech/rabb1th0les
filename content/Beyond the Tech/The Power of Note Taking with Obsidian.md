In our information driven society, it's as crucial as ever to be able to effectively take notes. Notes help us to retain information, whether that be in the action of taking the note, or revisiting at a later time to review. We've come a long way since taking a pen to piece of paper in that metal spiral notebook that we all remember so well.

Now, we have fancy tablets, digital notebooks, stylists that enable us to write on screens, the list goes on.. Having all of these tools is really great! That is, if we know how to use them. 

> A screwdriver will get the job done,  but a drill will get you there with a fraction of the effort and time.

During my early days of using these digital notebooks, I was using tools such as *Microsoft Word* and *OneNote*, which are basically a representation of a notebook in digital form, with a few extra functionalities. This did have some more power than having a normal notebook, such as being able to search through the text and being able to copy, paste, etc. But...it could still be better!

Then, I discovered Notion, which was a whole 'nother level better than what I had been using with ol' clunky OneNote. The power of Notion was incredible, the capability, the automation, the AI integration. I was using this for about 6 months and would have actually stuck with it, buuut I discovered another application called `Obsidian`. I would soon find out that this was going to change my whole thought process of note taking.

This then introduced me to *Zettelkasten* https://zettelkasten.de/overview/ notetaking. This is essentially a type of `PKM` or *Personal Knowledge Management* system. For me on beginning my path in cybersecurity, I understand that I will always to continuously learning and growing. To support that, it seemed crucial to create a structure (system) to automate my learning process. 

It has been a way to continuously learn and improve material as my knowledge and industry knowledge changes. The power of the different plugins that are in Obsidian extend it's capabilities and continues to expand with the open-source community.

Because of the open-source nature of this application, there is incredible capability in being able to built on top of the platform or integrate basically anything. With the power of API keys and interactions, it makes it possible to use with almost any other application. 

There are also some built-in capabilities, like the graph the can showcase connections between pages and tags, which really helps when trying to visualize your data from a different perspective. This makes data organization extremely easy. 

Here are the main plugins that I use and a brief use case:

* **Advanced Tables** - adds extra functionality to tables
* **Book Search** - searches Google and adds metadata for books in Properties
* **Calendar** - adds calendar Widget - helpful for tracking daily notes
* **Dataview** - create views to visualize your data
* **Diagrams.net** - functionality to use`draw.io` within pages
* **Emoji Toolbar** - allows emojis to be input into pages with ease
* **Iconize** - creates icons for your folders - makes more visually appealing
* **Kanban** - task tracking
* **Periodic Notes** - habit tracking with templates
* **Projects** - another view similar to Dataview
* **Smart Connections** - finds connections based on Vector relational database
* **Smart Templates**
* **Tasks**
* **Templater** - allows template creation

The plugins are really what make Obsidian your own. The plugins can be overwhelming at first and they definitely have been for me as I tend to like to dive in and try everything. After my trial and error, I would recommend integrating a plugin or two at a time. That way you get a chance to fully learn the capabilities of the plugin. There are some tools that have overlap in their functionality, such as `Kanban` and `Tasks`. If you stick to one and see which one suits your needs better, it can help to reduce the amount of plugins. Currently, I have them both integrated but am leaning more towards using tasks because of it's easy of implementation as well as the customization it offers. I would encourage anyone to explore on their own what works for their needs and stay curious!
