# 1. Categorize Your Goals:

Daily: Quick tasks or consistent habits (e.g., reviewing alerts, studying a tool, or sketching part of a diagram).
Weekly: Progress milestones (e.g., completing a workflow diagram or finishing a cybersecurity lab scenario).
Monthly: High-impact deliverables or reflections (e.g., a comprehensive report, project demo, or in-depth learning on a subject).

# 2. Define Goals Using SMART:

Specific: What exactly do you want to achieve?
Measurable: How will you track progress?
Achievable: Is it realistic within the time?
Relevant: Does it align with your larger projects?
Time-Bound: What’s the deadline?

# 3. Integrate Habit Tracking:

Use habit trackers (apps like Notion, Habitica, or spreadsheets).
Track metrics like "Diagrams created" or "Time spent learning tools."

# 4. Review and Reflect:

At the end of each week/month, review what worked, what didn’t, and adjust goals.
