When it comes to reverse engineering, it is way outside of my realm. That being said, I have used it within lab environments and am a complete n00b and don't know what I am doing. These are some tools that I have of people having great success.

# x64dbg
One tool that I have been using in the HacktheBox labs is `x64dbg`. Here is the link to their website: https://x64dbg.com/

x64dbg can help to debug errors or really get into the nitty gritty of processes and their related execution details. 

### Ghidra 
Developed by the NSA. Best for beginning reverse engineering.

This is a tool that I have heard over and over again of it's power. I have yet to use it and listing it here since I have heard such great things. 

### IDA Pro

IDA is a great tool that I have used minimally. It is definitely beyond my scope of work currently and hope to revisit it sometime in my later, more experienced years.
### Cutter
Open-source reverse engineering tool by Rizin
