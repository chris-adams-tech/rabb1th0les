- use MULTIPLE study sources and MULTIPLE sources for practice exams/questions. Watch videos, read books, perform your own research, etc
- play around with Nmap
- googling sample log output from security tools
- NEED to be able to be given a situation and provide a tool AND/OR a capability of that tool to improve the situation
- familiar with IoC symptoms
- they WILL provide you with either or both of an extremely asinine question or two VERY similar and correct answers
- uses for chatGPT (Be careful, as always with AI)
    - generating (limited) sample log output, email headers with SPF, DKIM, DMARC, firewall rules, etc. I also asked it to give me definitions/differences of concepts in table format which was really helpful.

In my learning experience, having a mix of hands-on, reading, and read-and-response type, activities has helped me retain more information. It also seems to be a non-linear way of learning, as there is no top to bottom. It all weaves back and forth and in and out of each other's relations. That's something that I've learned about cyber security. More often than not, an idea, protocol, application, will have some sort of relation to the industry as a whole.
