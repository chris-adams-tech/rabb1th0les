Hi my name is Chris Adams. This is my website of cyber and tech related subjects. Created with Obsidian and hosted via ~~GitHub~~ Cloudflare Pages. It's easy to get lost here. If you do there is navigation back here, `Home` and on the left side for site wide navigation. The right side will have a table of contents for within the page. Additionally, everything is searchable via tags. 

Hope you enjoy what you find here. ✌️

## Some more recent projects I've been working on

[[Active Directory - Attacks]] - still in progress but more content in here now \
[[Secretcon Active Directory server build]] \
[[Installing SilkETW]] - Just the beginning stages...working on a script to auto-deploy \

##### Here is the page listing the scenarios created: [[Cyber Scenarios - Home]]

There are so many interesting use case of AI...one that I have been exploring as I have been preparing for interviews, is using it to generate cyber scenarios so I can review the thought process of an investigation to build muscle memory of actions that need to be taken during an investigation. This can help tremendously to build the muscle memory prior to being in the high-stress environment.
