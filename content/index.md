Hi my name is Chris Adams. This is my website of cyber and tech related subjects. Created with Obsidian and hosted via ~~GitHub~~ Cloudflare Pages.

Hope you enjoy what you find here. ✌️


> [!info] Update 2024-11-10 10:18
> This website has been migrated to **Obsidian Quartz** and now being hosted via **Cloudflare Pages**. For now the other website at https://chris-adams-tech.github.io is still live, however, I will more than likely deprecate that once everything is fully migrated.


The theme was built with Obsidian Quartz and huge shoutout to the creator, https://github.com/jackyzha0, for putting this together. It uses `node.js` and `npm` to build the static website. He made it so easy to implement and customize to my own needs.

There are so many interesting use case of AI...one that I have been exploring as I have been preparing for interviews, is using it to generate cyber scenarios so I can review the thought process of an investigation to build muscle memory of actions that need to be taken during an investigation. This can help tremendously to build the muscle memory prior to being in the high-stress environment. 

For some people that do not act well under pressure, this offers an alternative to prepare yourself for such situations.
