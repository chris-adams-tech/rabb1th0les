Hi my name is Chris Adams. This is my website of cyber and tech related subjects. Created with Obsidian and hosted via ~~GitHub~~ Cloudflare Pages.

Hope you enjoy what you find here. ✌️


> [!info] Update 2024-11-10 10:18
> This website has been migrated to **Obsidian Quartz** and now being hosted via **Cloudflare Pages**. For now the other website at https://chris-adams-tech.github.io is still live, however, I will more than likely deprecate that once everything is fully migrated.


The theme was built with Obsidian Quartz and huge shoutout to the creator, https://github.com/jackyzha0, for putting this together. It uses `node.js` and `npm` to build the static website. He made it so easy to implement and customize to my own needs.


Check out the about pages for more information about myself and this project. \
