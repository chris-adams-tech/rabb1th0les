# What are Windows Services?
---

Think of Windows services as those quiet, hardworking employees who show up before everyone else and keep things running behind the scenes. You know, like that maintenance person who somehow fixes everything in your office building before you even notice there was a problem.

# What do they do?
These services are basically programs that run in the background of your Windows PC, and they don't need you to log in or click anything to do their jobs. They start up with Windows and keep doing their thing whether you're actively using your computer or not. Pretty neat, right?

#### Some examples you might recognize:
- Windows Update (yep, that thing that bugs you about updates)
- Print Spooler (manages your printing queue)
- Windows Defender (your built-in bodyguard)
- Network services (keeping you connected to the internet)

### Now, here's where it gets spicy from a cybersecurity perspective ðŸ‘€

Services can be both a blessing and a curse for security. They're like having doors into your house - some you need, but each one is potentially another way for bad guys to get in. Here's why security folks care about them:

#### The Good:
- Security services protect your system (like antivirus)
- They can monitor for threats 24/7
- They help maintain system health

#### The Bad:
- Attackers love targeting services because they run with high privileges
- Malware can create fake services to persist on your system
- Compromised services are gold mines for hackers since they run automatically and often have deep system access

#### The Ugly:
- Remember WannaCry? That nasty ransomware spread partly through a vulnerable Windows service
- Hackers often disguise malicious programs as legitimate services (sneaky!)

## Pro Security Tips:
- Only run services you actually need
- Keep them updated (seriously, those patches matter)
- Regularly check what services are running on your system
- Be suspicious of any new services you didn't install

Think of services like employees in your digital company - you want to keep tabs on who's working for you and make sure they're not secretly working for someone else! 

## It is equally as important to monitor these Windows Services, check out why below:

# Understanding the Process of a New Service Installation

When a new service is installed, it generates logs in three different providers:
1. **Event Log
2. **Sysmon
3. **ETW***
