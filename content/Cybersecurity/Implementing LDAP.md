Implementing an open-source LDAP authentication server involves several steps. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is commonly used for centralized authentication, and there are various open-source implementations available, such as OpenLDAP. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing an OpenLDAP server for authentication:

1. **Install OpenLDAP:**

- On Ubuntu, you can install OpenLDAP using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils
```

 - During the installation, you'll be prompted to set an LDAP administrator password. Remember this password, as you'll need it later.

1. **Configure OpenLDAP:**
- OpenLDAP's configuration is stored in the `/etc/ldap/slapd.d/` directory.
- Edit the configuration file `cn=config.ldif` to configure the server settings. You can use a text editor or the `ldapmodify` command to make changes.

1. **Define the LDAP schema:**
- LDAP uses a schema to define the structure of the directory. You can use the default schema or define your custom schema based on your needs.
- Schema files are typically stored in the `/etc/ldap/schema/` directory.

1. **Add LDAP entries:**
- Use the `ldapadd` command to add entries to the LDAP directory. This includes adding users, groups, and any other relevant information.
- LDAP entries are typically stored in LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files.

1. **Configure LDAP client:**
- To enable LDAP authentication on client machines, you need to configure the client to use the LDAP server.
- Edit the `/etc/ldap.conf` file on the client machines to configure LDAP authentication settings.

1. **Test LDAP authentication:**
- Use the `ldapsearch` command to test LDAP authentication.
- For example, to search for a user:

```
ldapsearch -x -h ldap_server_ip -b "dc=example,dc=com" -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W "(&(objectClass=*)(uid=username))"`
```

1. **Secure the LDAP server:**
- Ensure that the LDAP server is secured by using TLS/SSL encryption for communications.
- Modify the `slapd.conf` file to enable TLS/SSL.

1. **Manage LDAP users and groups:**
- Use tools like `ldapadd`, `ldapmodify`, and `ldapdelete` to manage LDAP users and groups.
- You can also use GUI tools like Apache Directory Studio for easier management.

1. **Monitor and maintain the LDAP server:**
- Regularly monitor the LDAP server for performance and security.
- Backup the LDAP directory regularly to prevent data loss.

Implementing an LDAP server requires a good understanding of LDAP concepts and the specific needs of your organization. It's recommended to refer to the OpenLDAP documentation for detailed instructions and best practices.
