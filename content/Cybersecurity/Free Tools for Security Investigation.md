### Process Hacker
Is a tool that can be used to analyze the active working processes in the system in detail. Download: https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php

### FullEventLogView
Collects the Windows event logs in a single window. May collect proof about correct filters that are to be applied especially when the attack time frame is known. Download: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/full_event_log_view.html

### Autoruns
Is Microsoft sysinternal tool. Helps determine the attackerâ€™s persistence actions. Download: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns

### LastActivityView
Sorts activities that have occurred on devices with the data it has collected from various sources. May be very beneficial when a specific time filter is applied. Download: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/computer_activity_view.html

### BrowsingHistoryView
Reads the history of the web search engine on the device and shows it on a single screen. May be used to determine attacks like phishing and web exploit. Download: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html

Note: As we have mentioned before, there are different equivalent tools that can be used. Itâ€™s not the tool we use thatâ€™s important, but itâ€™s what we analyze/control with those tools. You can even code your own tool.
