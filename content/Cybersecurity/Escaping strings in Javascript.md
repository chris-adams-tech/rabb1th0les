```

Strings are used to represent text-based data and are mostly defined using either single quotes (') or double quotes (").

For example:
```javascript
let name1 = 'The Dude';
let name2 = "The Dude";
```

This identifies the data in between the `' '` or `" "` as the string `The Dude`.

If we wanted to encapsulate another string inside of that string, there are 3 different methods to accomplish this. Otherwise, an error gets thrown because it is reading it as the string is over and continues to read, as if it were code.

```javascript
let quote = "He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"";

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'I'
```

As you can see, it is reading the line `"He said, "` as the entirety of the string, processing the rest of the line as code, resulting in an error.

One way to combat this is to use the **Opposite string**, meaning if you are using `' '`, then on either the inside or outside of that clause, place the opposite, either `'` or `"`.

Here's an example:
```javascript
let quote = 'He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"';
console.log(quote); // He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"

let apostrophe = "It's a beautiful day";
console.log(apostrophe); // It's a beautiful day
```

This can also be done by using an **escape** character.

Here's an example:
```javascript
let quote = "He said, \"I learned from freeCodeCamp!\"";
console.log(quote); // He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"

let apostrophe = 'It\'s a beautiful day';
console.log(apostrophe); // It's a beautiful day
```

**Template Literals** can also be used, using syntax `${expression}`

```javascript
let quote = `He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"`;
console.log(quote); // He said, "I learned from freeCodeCamp!"
```

With Template Literals, you don't need to use backslashes to escape characters. Instead, you simply wrap the string in `backticks`.
