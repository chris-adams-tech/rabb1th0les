"**Document Object Model** (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents that allows to edit structure, style and content of web pages in **Javascript**".

## Accessing DOM elements

In order to make any changes, the `document` object is called.

```javascript
// Accessing an element by its ID
const headerElement = document.getElementById('header');

// Accessing elements by class name
const paragraphs = document.getElementsByClassName('paragraph');

// Accessing elements by tag name
const images = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
```

##### This retrieves the data needed, in order to modify the 3 elements that were pulled. `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName` , `getElementsByTagName`.

Then, the modifications can happen.

```javascript
// Modifying the content of an element
headerElement.innerHTML = 'New Header Text';
```

# Events and Event Handling
These events are similar to a *conditional clause* where is a user does a certain action, the script executes code in response, such as when a user clicks a button, a new window opens.

### Event Listeners

In order to get a response from the action, such as clicking a button, **event listeners** are implemented to "listen" for specific types of events. 

Here's an example:

```javascript
// Accessing a button element
const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

// Adding a click event listener
myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button Clicked!');
});
```

#### This brings us to why is it important in Cyber security?

`DOM Based XSS` is the focus of a vulnerability that can be present in these environments. 

##### In this attack, that attack **payload** is executed from modifying the `DOM` environment in the victim's browser (**client-side vulnerability**).
