# Phishing & Social Engineering: A Detailed Analysis Guide

## Types of Phishing Attacks

### 1. Traditional Phishing
**Description:** Mass-distributed emails targeting large groups of users
**Example:**
```
Subject: Your Amazon Account Has Been Suspended
From: security@arnazon-support.com
Message: Dear Customer, Your Amazon account has been temporarily suspended due to unusual activity. Click here to verify your account: [malicious link]
```
**Red Flags:**
- Slightly misspelled domain (arnazon vs amazon)
- Generic greeting
- Urgency in message
- Suspicious link URL

### 2. Spear Phishing
**Description:** Targeted attacks using personal information
**Example:**
```
Subject: Q4 Budget Review - Action Required
From: cfo.john.smith@company-corp.net [spoofed]
Message: Hi Sarah, Following up on yesterday's meeting, I need you to review the updated Q4 numbers ASAP. Please download the spreadsheet here: [malicious link]
I'm in a board meeting but need this within the hour.
Thanks, John [CFO signature block]
```
**Red Flags:**
- Spoofed internal email
- Reference to real events/people
- Time pressure
- Unusual request from senior executive

### 3. Business Email Compromise (BEC)
**Description:** Targeting financial transactions through compromised or spoofed business communications
**Example:**
```
Subject: Re: Invoice Payment Update
From: accounts@supplier-company.com
Message: Dear [Finance Team Member],
We've updated our banking details. Please use the following account for the pending payment of Invoice #45692:
Bank: [Bank Name]
Account: [Number]
Swift: [Code]
Please process this urgently as we're closing our books.
```
**Red Flags:**
- Last-minute banking changes
- Urgency
- Irregular payment process
- Slight variations in email domain

## Common Social Engineering Tactics

### 1. Pretexting
**Scenario:** Attacker poses as IT support
```
"Hi, this is Dave from IT Support. We're seeing some unusual activity from your workstation. I need your login details to run some diagnostics..."
```

### 2. Quid Pro Quo
**Scenario:** Offering something in exchange for information
```
"Congratulations! You've won a $50 Amazon gift card. Just verify your employee credentials at [malicious link] to claim..."
```

### 3. Baiting
**Scenario:** Using physical media
```
[USB drives labeled "Confidential - Q4 Salary Review" left in company parking lot]
```

## Detection Mechanisms

### 1. Email Header Analysis
```
Received: from mail.legitcompany.com [192.168.1.1]
X-Originating-IP: [suspicious IP]
Return-Path: <different-domain@attacker.com>
```

### 2. URL Analysis
Common Deceptions:
- microsoft-security.tk
- amazonn.com
- google.login-verify.com
- dropbox.file-share.net

### 3. DMARC/SPF/DKIM Indicators
```
Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 192.0.2.1)
smtp.mailfrom=company.com; dkim=fail (signature did not verify)
header.d=company.com; dmarc=fail action=quarantine
```

## Advanced Attack Patterns

### 1. Multi-Stage Phishing
```
Stage 1: LinkedIn connection request from fake recruiter
Stage 2: Job discussion over email
Stage 3: Request to fill out "application form" (credential harvester)
Stage 4: Malware disguised as "salary calculator"
```

### 2. Supply Chain Compromise
```
Legitimate vendor email account compromised
↓
Attacker monitors communication patterns
↓
Hijacks real invoice thread
↓
Sends updated banking details
```
