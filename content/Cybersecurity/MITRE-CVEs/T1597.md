# Summary

Think of this like a detective doing background research before investigating a case. Just as investigators in shows like "Criminal Minds" gather intelligence about their suspects through various databases and closed sources, attackers perform similar reconnaissance using paid subscription services, academic databases, and other closed-source intelligence gathering methods.

# Technical Details

## Affected Systems

- Any system with internet access
- Systems with access to subscription-based services
- Corporate networks with access to paid research databases

## Required Privileges

- No administrative privileges required
- May require valid credentials for subscription services
- Possible corporate VPN access

## Event Table

|Event ID|MITRE Association|Kill Chain Phase|Command Line/Activity|Tools Used|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|4648|T1597.001|Reconnaissance|Explicit credential login|Browser|
|4624|T1597.002|Reconnaissance|Interactive logon|Subscription services|
|4688|T1597.003|Reconnaissance|Process creation for downloads|wget, curl|

## Attack Steps

1. Access Subscription Services
##### Using PowerShell to authenticate to services 
```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://subscription-service.com" -Credential $cred
```

2. Download Research Papers
##### Using wget to download PDFs
```bash
wget --user=username --password=password https://academic-database.com/paper.pdf
```

3. Extract Technical Information
##### Using Python to parse PDFs
```python
import PyPDF2 pdf_file = open('paper.pdf', 'rb') pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)`
```
## Detection Rules

### Windows Event Log

```xml
<Select Path="Security">     *[System[(EventID=4648)]] and    *[EventData[Data[@Name='TargetServerName'] contains 'subscription-service.com']] 
</Select>
```

### Network Detection

```yaml
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (     msg:"Potential Closed Source Research";    flow:established,to_server;    content:"subscription-service.com"; http_host;    classtype:policy-violation;    sid:1000001;    rev:1; )`
```

# Best Practices

- Monitor for unusual access patterns to subscription services
- Track downloads of technical documentation
- Implement network segmentation for research activities
- Use DLP solutions to monitor data exfiltration
- Implement proper logging for subscription service access

The attack utilizes legitimate services, making it difficult to detect malicious intent. Focus detection efforts on unusual patterns of access and large-scale downloads from these services.
