# Summary

Remote Service Session Hijacking (T1563) is like the digital equivalent of someone stealing your seat when you get up at a coffee shop - except in this case, they're taking over your remote desktop connection. This technique was famously portrayed in films like "Sneakers" (1992) where attackers intercept and hijack connections, though the modern implementation is far more sophisticated.

# Technical Details

## Environment Requirements

- Windows Server 2016/2019 with Remote Desktop Services enabled
- Administrative privileges required
- Vulnerable RDP configuration allowing session hijacking

## Attack Table

|Event ID|MITRE ATT&CK|Kill Chain Phase|Command Line|Tools Used|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|4624|T1563.002|Lateral Movement|tscon.exe {session_id} /dest:{session_name}|Built-in Windows tools|
|4778|T1563.002|Lateral Movement|query session|RDPWrap, TSCon|
|4779|T1563.002|Execution|qwinsta /server:{target}|PsExec|
|1149|T1563.002|Execution|N/A|Mimikatz|

## Technical Steps

### 1. Reconnaissance

powershell

`# List all active sessions query session # or qwinsta /server:<target_server>`

### 2. Session Hijacking

cmd

Copy

`# From an administrative command prompt tscon <target_session_ID> /dest:<your_session_name>`

### 3. RDP Configuration Exploitation

powershell

Copy

`# Check RDP settings reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"`

## Rule Creation

### Detection Rule (Sigma Format)

yaml

Copy

`title: RDP Session Hijacking Detection description: Detects potential RDP session hijacking attempts status: experimental author: Your Name logsource:     product: windows    service: security detection:     selection:        EventID:            - 4624  # Successful logon            - 4778  # Session reconnected            - 4779  # Session disconnected        LogonType: 10 # RemoteInteractive    condition: selection falsepositives:     - Legitimate administrative session management level: high`

## Prevention Measures

1. Implement Network Level Authentication (NLA)
2. Enable RDP Restricted Admin Mode
3. Monitor for suspicious session switching
4. Implement proper session timeout policies

# Additional Considerations

- This attack requires administrative privileges
- Modern Windows systems have additional protections against this attack
- The attack is more likely to succeed in environments with legacy systems
- Real-time monitoring and alerting are crucial for detection

The success of this attack largely depends on misconfigurations such as:

- Disabled NLA
- Weak RDP security settings
- Insufficient session monitoring
- Lack of proper access controls

Remember to always test in a controlled environment and never on production systems without proper authorization.
