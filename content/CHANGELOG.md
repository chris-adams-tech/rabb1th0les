> [!INFO] Note about the changes
> As much as I wanted to share EVERYTHING, it seems to not make sense to also have my portfolio entangled in it. I've noticed it creates a lot of clutter. For now, I have taken out all of my study notes and will keep it to my specific project work. I may just have two websites, one for my portfolio work and one for notes/study.
